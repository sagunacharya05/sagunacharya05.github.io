      <h2>Class Contract</h2>
      <p>
        I, Acharya, Sagun agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in
        my Spring 2026, ITIS 3135, Front End Web Development with my instructor,
        Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on
        publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will
        not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that
        I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts
        for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to
        turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given
        the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many
        examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that
        I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste
        code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries)
        and never from my classmates. Signed: Sagun Acharya, 25 January, 2026.
