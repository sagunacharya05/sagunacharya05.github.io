      <h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Good CRAP Principles:
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> The Apple website uses consistent font
            sizes and colors. The header at the top of the page has a large font
            and supporting text is smaller, letting the user know exactly where
            to look first on the website. The contrasting colors also show the
            user the focal point of the page, which in this case would be any
            product Apple wants to sell.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repitition:</strong> The Apple website has consistent
            navigation bars, call-to-actions, and fonts thoughout. This means
            that the website is cohesive and easy for the user to understand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> The Apple website has very strong
            alignment. It uses a grid-like system that means that every page's
            format and information is consistent to the theme. It means that the
            website is easy to read and understand to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> In any section on the Apple website, the
            headline, sub-headline, and navigation bar are all grouped very
            close to one another. This shows the user that these three elements
            belong next to the image of the product they are describing. On top
            of this, Apple also uses a lot of white space to differentiate
            sections of their website, which helps the user understand that it
            is a new section of the website.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Bad CRAP Principles:
          <a href="https://www2.pnwx.com/" target="_blank"
            >Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a
          >
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> Rather than having a good contrast in
            colors throughout the website, the PNWX website uses vibrant and
            strong colors that often do not contrast with one another, leading
            to the website being hard to read and undertand to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repitition:</strong> Normally, a good website would have
            consistent font and color options. However, the PNWX website uses
            many different fonts and colors, making it seem like something that
            was put together haphazardly and without much thought.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> A website that adheres to the CRAP
            principles should create invisible lines that connect elements
            throughout the website. However, the PNWX website heavily relies on
            center alignment, which is not optimal for websites that have a lot
            of text content. This also makes it hard for the user to flow
            through the website. Instead of the website flowing properly, the
            user has to search the screen for the next line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> Rather than having related sections of
            the website be closely grouped together, the PNWX website has a
            massive list of products all tightly bunched up into one table. On
            top of this, the lack of whitespace makes the user percieve all of
            these products as one large group, which may not be completely
            accurate.
